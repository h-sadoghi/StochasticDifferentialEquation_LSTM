    "### **White Noise**\n",
    "White noise is a basic stochastic process with the following properties:\n",
    "- **Mean**: \\( E[X(t)] = 0 \\)\n",
    "- **Covariance**:$ (E[X(t)X(s)] = \\sigma^2 \\delta(t-s) )$, where $(\\delta)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n",
    "- **Power spectral density**: Uniform across all frequencies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Mathematically, white noise is a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variables, often modeled as Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance $( \\sigma^2 )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Wiener Process (Brownian Motion)**\n",
    "The Wiener process, denoted as $( W(t) )$, is a continuous-time stochastic process with the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Initial condition**: $( W(0) = 0 )$\n",
    "*   **Independent increments**: For any $( 0 \\leq t_1 < t_2 < \\dots < t_n )$, the increments $( W(t_2) - W(t_1), \\dots, W(t_n) - W(t_{n-1}) )$ are independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Continuous paths**: The sample paths of $( W(t) )$ are almost surely continuous.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normal increments**: $( W(t) - W(s) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t - s) ) for ( t \\geq s )$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "-  **probability density function (PDF)** of $( W(t) )$ is normally , i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_W(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi t}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2t}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wiener process is the integral of white noise, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "W(t) = \\int_0^t X(s) ds.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lévy Process**\n",
    "A Lévy process is a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments. The Wiener process is a special case of a Lévy process. In general, a Lévy process $( X(t) )$ satisfies:\n",
    "- **Stationary increments**: $( X(t) - X(s) )$ has the same distribution as $( X(t-s) )$.\n",
    "- **Independent increments**: Increments over non-overlapping intervals are independent.\n",
    "- **Càdlàg paths**: The paths of a Lévy process are right-continuous with left limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Lévy processes, the **characteristic function** is given by the **Lévy-Khintchine formula**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[ e^{i u X(t)} ] = \\exp( t ( i u \\gamma - \\frac{1}{2} u^2 \\sigma^2 + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} ( e^{i u x} - 1 - i u x \\mathbf{1}_{|x|<1} ) \\nu(dx) ) )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $( \\gamma )$ is the drift, $( \\sigma ) $is the volatility, and$ ( \\nu )$ is the Lévy measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of the Processes:\n",
    "- **White Noise**: Pure randomness with no memory; independent and identically distributed increments.\n",
    "- **Wiener Process**: Continuous-time process with normally distributed increments, essentially a \"smooth\" version of white noise.\n",
    "- **Lévy Process**: Generalization of both Wiener and Poisson processes; includes both continuous Brownian motion and discrete jumps.\n"
